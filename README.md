# Simple Arch Packages Installer Script

This script autoinstalls and autoconfigures a fully-functioning and minimal Arch Linux environment.

## try commands

Each command (install, pre-commands, post-commands) is checked to see if it was completed successfully. Additionally there is a `try` command to deactivate this mechanism. If a command fails, the program prints the trace and terminates. To use the try command feature add a try at the beginning of the command for each command that may fail.

Example:

```
pacman -Rdd i3-wm
```

with try command:

```
try pacman -Rdd i3-wm
```
